# Black-box regression harness

Runs two CDN images side by side on the same generated datasets, sends both the
same requests, and reports every response that differs.

```
pip install numpy zstd
python harness.py --baseline tuffr5/sisf_cdn@sha256:83d43adc... --baseline-platform linux/amd64 \
                  --candidate sisf_cdn:candidate --work /tmp/regress \
                  --allow expected_diffs.json --report /tmp/report.json
```

- `fixtures.py` writes the datasets. Its bytes match pySISF 0.4.1 and the
  portal's tiled writer (checked file by file when it was written).
- Reads: status code and SHA-256 of every body. Writes: the portal's
  read-merge-PATCH sequence on each server's own copy, then re-reads and a
  byte comparison of every file on disk.
- A server that dies is recorded as CRASH and restarted. Two crashes on the
  same request count as the same behaviour; every crash is listed either way.
- `expected_diffs.json` lists the differences that are intended, each with a
  reason. Anything else fails the run.

Compare like with like: run both images on amd64. An integer division by zero
that kills the process on x86-64 returns 0 on arm64, so an arm64 candidate can
pass a case that crashes in production.
